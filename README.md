Go Webserver Cookbook for Amazon OpsWorks
===============================

We have several Go web applications that we run at http://www.crowdmob.com and wanted to be able to deploy them
using Amazon's OpsWorks http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/ to get auto-scaling and auto-provisioning.

This is the recipe we use which we are using in production.  It `git clones` into a `releases/{NOW}` directory, builds the app (assuming your main package is defined in a go source file named `APPNAME.go`), symlinks the `current` directory to it, and tells `monit` to restart the service representing your server.

Dependencies
-----------------------------
This cookbook depends on the following:

- `deploy`: the base amazon deploy recipe at https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/master/deploy
- `golang`: the installation of go recipe at https://github.com/crowdmob/chef-golang
- `monit`: the monit package to ensure your server is running, and tries to restart it if not at https://github.com/crowdmob/chef-monit

Additionally, you must use `Godep` for storing code dependencies.

Only Use 64 Bit EC2 Instances
-----------------------------
At this time, the `golang` cookbook mentioned doesn't dynamically choose the right binary at runtime, based on CPU.  That means that it assumes a 64 bit ec2 instance, which is a large instance or better.

Select the `Custom` Layer Type
-----------------------------
When you make your Layer in OpsWorks, be sure to select Other > Custom, rather than "Rails App Server" or some other pre-defined stack. 

Custom Chef Recipes Setup
-----------------------------
To deploy your app, you'll have to make sure 2 of the recipes in this cookbook are run.

1. `golang::install` should run during the setup phase of your node in OpsWorks
2. `goapp::configure` should run during the configuration phase of your node in OpsWorks
3. `goapp::deploy` should run during (every) deployment phase of your node.

Databag Setup
-----------------------------
This cookbook relies on a databag, which you should set in Amazon OpsWorks as your Stack's "Custom Chef JSON", with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME": {
      "application_type": "goapp",
      "gofile": "my_app.go",
      "test_url": "/",
      "env": {
        "PORT": 80,
        "or_whatever": "you want in env.properties"
      },
      "config": ["other"]
    }
  },
  "other": {
    "option1": "value1"
  }
}
```

Important note: this cookbook double-checks that your `application_type` is set to `goapp`. If `application_type` is not set to `goapp`, none of the cookbook will run for that app.  If `gofile` is omitted, uses `APPLICATION_NAME.go`.  `test_url` will be tested by monit to ensure server is still up (default "/").

If you include a layers key, only matching layer will deploy this application.  E.g.

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "blog": {
      "application_type": "goapp",
      "layers": ["blog-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `blog` app will only deploy onto the `blog-server` layer.

If you include a config key, the matching root-level values will be copied to the properties file as sections, allowing other cookbook configuration to be made available to your application. e.g.

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "blog": {
      "config": ["wordpress"],
    }
  },
  "wordpress": {
    "database": "db.host"
  }
}
```

The resulting env.properties file will contain the following sections:

```
[wordpress]
database=db.host
```

How it Works
-----------------------------
This cookbook builds and runs a go webapp in the following way:

- The `APPNAME.go` source file is built using `go get .` followed by `go build -o ./goapp_APPNAME_server server.go`.  That results in an executable of your application at `/srv/www/APPNAME/current/goapp_APPNAME_server`
- A `env.properties` file is created using your databag and output at `/srv/www/APPNAME/shared/config/env.properties`
- A `goapp-APPNAME-server-daemon` shell script is created and placed in  `/srv/www/APPNAME/current/`, which handles start and restart commands, by calling  `/srv/www/APPNAME/current/goapp_APPNAME_server -c /srv/www/APPNAME/shared/config/env.properties` and outputting logs to `/srv/www/APPNAME/shared/log/goapp.log`
- A `goapp_APPNAME_server.monitrc` monit script is created, which utilizes the `goapp-APPNAME-server-daemon` script for startup and shutdown, and is placed in `/etc/monit.d` or `/etc/monit/conf.d`, depending on your OS (defined in the `monit` cookbook)
- `monit` is restarted, which incorporates the the new files.



A little about `goapp`
-----------------------------
For the purposes of this cookbook, though, the only thing that it assumes about your webapp is:

1. Your `main` function is in a file called `APPNAME.go` in the base of your project. 
2. Your `APPNAME.go` program won't die if it's sent a `-c` flag at the command line with a filepath after it, like `go run server.go -c /path/to/env.properties`.  Whether or not it uses that file, however, is up to it.
